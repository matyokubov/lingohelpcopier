            <h2>In <strong>1%</strong> of cases <strong>"evolve within"</strong> is used</h2>
            <p>This conference proposes to show how the genre has <strong>evolved within</strong> African and Indian writings, including those of the diaspora.</p><p>They do not progress toward a predetermined state (as with master planning strategies ), but are always <strong>evolving within</strong> a loose envelope of constraints.</p><p>Devices like the iPad and the Kindle are successful because the functionality is not entirely limited to the device and therefore it can continue to <strong>evolve within</strong> a larger context.</p><p>The primary paradox is that our brain did not evolve for reading but writing must have evolved for our brain, that is, writing systems must have <strong>evolved within</strong> our brain's constraints.</p>        </section>

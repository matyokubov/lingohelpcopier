            <h2>In <strong>38%</strong> of cases <strong>"on guitar"</strong> is used</h2>
            <p>ISDP emerged after dean (drummer) wonder if he could play drums after he felt that he sucks <strong>on guitars</strong>.</p><p>Why, you ask? Because the chords in these keys are easier to play <strong>on guitar</strong>, so songwriters tend to stick with them.</p><p>They eventually formed Lionize with Bergman <strong>on guitar</strong>, Chris Brooks on keyboard, Henry Upton on bass, Mel Randolph on drums, and Tim Sult <strong>on guitar</strong>.</p><p>I am speaking of such people as Lowell Fulson, and of course the incomparable T-Bone Walker, who as much as anyone is BB's most direct influence <strong>on guitar</strong>.</p><p>The band worked with him to get the best sound, with particular input from Lefty Bates <strong>on guitar</strong> and Red Holloway, as designated tenor saxophonist and joint arranger.</p><p>MUG is led by Ulmer <strong>on guitar</strong>, bass and vocals; Cathy Lowry on keyboards, flute, recorder, bass, vocals; Steve Herald on drums; and Jimmy McCutchen <strong>on guitar</strong>, bass and vocals.</p><p>I use to back up melody players with my DADGAD taylor but now i wanted to learn tunes <strong>on guitar</strong> (I really wish to start with Ulliean Pipes hehe) as i saw on Arty mcglinn and others.</p><p>Her backup band was made up of some of the Bay's local talent; Steve Russell on piano, Greg Lyon on bass, Geoff Smith <strong>on guitar</strong>, Dave Sanders on drums, and backing vocals by Leigh Carriage.</p><p>The variations <strong>on guitars</strong>, strings, drums, keyboards and brass also certainly express the clarity of the production, leaving it difficult to believe that it was recorded over thirty years ago.</p>        </section>

            <h2>In <strong>22%</strong> of cases <strong>"of guitar"</strong> is used</h2>
            <p>Tens of thousands <strong>of guitar</strong> Pro format files are available on the Internet.</p><p>A lot of my favourite records have lots <strong>of guitars</strong> and lots of different sounds going on.</p><p>Guitar lessons for beginners are given to those people who desire to learn the art <strong>of guitar</strong> playing.</p><p>As the set seemed ready to close, a couple <strong>of guitar</strong> chugs from Could You Be Loved told everyone what was coming.</p><p>Was there someone in Strange Idols like that? What kind <strong>of guitars</strong> did you use though? Davey: I played a Fender Telecaster Thinline mostly.</p><p>It's not really that major of a song and it does suffer in comparison to other Smiths songs by the lack <strong>of guitar</strong> and bass, but it's still an excellent b-side.</p><p>Then there are the consistently brilliant Errors, who should be enormous: an electronic trio combining wandering synth melodies with stabs <strong>of guitar</strong> and unfathomably tight drumming.</p><p>With Warning you could sense that the band were aware of their importance and influence in the world <strong>of guitar</strong> music but they also recognised that some sonic reinvention was in order.</p>        </section>

            <p>It mostly hold cable and repair tools <strong>for guitars</strong>.</p><p>He then signed up <strong>for guitar</strong> lessons with renowned instructor Joe Satriani.</p><p>Being conscious of bass lines and developing moving bass lines appropriate for the tune is a major role <strong>for guitar</strong> and piano players.</p><p>It will also write tablature <strong>for guitar</strong>, banjo, mandolin and other instruments based on your sheet music, and will even let you set up a custom tuning for the guitar tab! A great buy at $40.</p>        </section>

            <h2>In <strong>11%</strong> of cases <strong>"with guitar"</strong> is used</h2>
            <p>It made me realise I could write an album <strong>with guitar</strong>ists and get in the best electronic producers.</p><p>The track begins sparsely with crisp percussion and muffled keyboards, building layer upon layer, <strong>with guitars</strong> and reverb-filled, effervescent vocals.</p><p>I recently bought an electric guitar (esp mh-50) and set myself up <strong>with guitar</strong> rig so I could practice without blasting an amp and annoying everyone within earshot.</p><p>The track is warped almost out of recognition <strong>with guitar</strong> effects, however positioned here it feels like a throwaway (an alternate version is also included at the end of the album).</p>        </section>

            <p>I won because I made good score <strong>in guitar</strong> hero-like game.</p><p>Self-taught, Kato's curiosity <strong>in guitar</strong> was nurtured by an emerging online community of musicians on YouTube.</p><p>I played classical guitar style, although the guitar itself was a folk guitar ), but it's fun to play with the amp settings <strong>in guitar</strong> rig.</p><p>For anyone interested <strong>in guitar</strong> conversions I found a company on ebay called soares'y guitars that do this type of thing (they also have a website if you want to google them.</p>        </section>

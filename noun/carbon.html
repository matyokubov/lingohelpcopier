            <p>And one idea that a few economists keep knocking around is a fee <strong>on carbon</strong> emissions.</p><p>She said that a third runway would not damage Britain's efforts to meet its cap <strong>on carbon</strong> emissions.</p><p>Therefore there must be negative feedback <strong>on carbon</strong> dioxide in order for sinks and sources to be matched.</p><p>In California, South Korea and Australia new emissions-trading schemes have recently put a price <strong>on carbon</strong>.</p><p>Banking group HSBC tells us that: Barack Obama may consider introducing a tax <strong>on carbon</strong> emissions to help cut the U.</p><p>But the HSBC note to investors said that a relatively modest $20-a-ton tax <strong>on carbon</strong> emissions could slash the federal deficit by $1.</p><p>We focus too much <strong>on carbon</strong> expenditure and not enough on the carbon cycle which makes us dangerously blind to the impact of biodiversity.</p><p>Hence, we should stop trying to shackle economic growth by imposing controls <strong>on carbon</strong> emissions, and get rid of subsidies on renewable energy.</p><p>Some advocates prefer a tax <strong>on carbon</strong>, while others are pushing for a cap-and-trade market similar to the one credited with reducing sulfur emissions.</p><p>So I ask this Congress to send me legislation that places a market-based cap <strong>on carbon</strong> pollution and drives the production of more renewable energy in America.</p>        </section>
